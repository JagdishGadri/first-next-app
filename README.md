## This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. 

## This repository contains 3 independent Next.js Projects. 

1. Events App (branch: using-api-routes-in-events-app)
2. Authentication App (branch: authentication)
3. Feedback-Form App (branch: backend-with-api-routes)

The Events app is built by creating different branch for each functionality implemented in the app.
i.e., first the "file-based-routing" is created, then the "serverside-rendering-in-events-app" is created to implement server side rendering in the existing app. 

Here is the whole map of project's all branches in progressive order: 
>file-based-routing-project
>>serverside-rendering-in-events-app
>>>using-api-routes-in-events-app

So, You can access the basic app in "file-based-routing-project" branch and full-fledged(so called!) app in "using-api-routes-in-events-app" branch.
